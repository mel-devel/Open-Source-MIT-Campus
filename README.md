A 3D Printable Map of the MIT Campus

# About the Map
This repo is an open source 3D printable campus map of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The map was developed as part of the Tangible Map project and created by the Design Lab at MIT. The map seeks to blend physical and digital information into a seamless interface for exploring live data on the MIT campus.

The Tangible Map is designed to be deployed within a wide range of environments, with varying equipment. To allow for further development we are making the 3D printable map of the MIT campus available. Each building has been optimized and verified for 3D printing. Feel free to contact us with any inquiries or visit the map at the MIT ATLAS Center.

# How to Print
For best results, we recommend printing the buildings using a Form 2 SLA 3D printer (formlabs.com). If attempting to print the buildings with fused filament or other technology, the buildings should be scaled by a factor of 2 or more to achieve the fine detail. No support structures should be necessary for printing, instead, buildings should be placed directly on the build palatform.
